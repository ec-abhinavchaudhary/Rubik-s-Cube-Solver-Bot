# Rubik's-Cube-Solver-Bot

These are all the source code and design files for our Rubik's Cube Solver Bot that uses the Thistlethwaite Algorithm to solve the Rubik's cube from any scrambled state back to the solved unscrambled state.

Primary files include:

* CAD drawings for 3D printed parts, printed using PLA(Polylactic Acid or Polylactide)
* Arduino sketch for controlling stepper motor using L298N Motor Drivers
* Code for the solving application
* Various other stuff(like testcodes and other driver codes)
